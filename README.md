# Gravity model of international migration

This repo contains R code that produces an example of a simple gravity model of migration from Sub-Saharan African countries to OECD countries
for the period 1997-2020. Data on migration flows is taken from the OECD International Migration Database, and data on distance,
common languages and former colonial relationships is taken from the GeoDist CEPII database. GDP per capita data is obtained from the
World Development Indicators by the World Bank.
